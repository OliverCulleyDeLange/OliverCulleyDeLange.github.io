            <h3>Skillset</h3>
        </header>
        <p>
            I do <strong>backend applications</strong> mainly written in <strong>Java 8 and Spring</strong>
            (Since March 2014).
            I also do <strong>Android apps</strong> (Since March 2016), so I guess I'm a mobile full stack
            developer.
            I sometimes put my <strong>technical business analyst</strong> hat on, and write technical
            stories in <strong>Jira</strong>.
            I also sometimes put my <strong>QA</strong> hat on, and test other developers stories.
            I have exclusively worked in <strong>Agile</strong> dev teams.
            I try to get involved at a higher <strong>architectural level</strong> and understand system
            integrations, mainly because I like to know what is going on.
        </p>
        <p>
            I <strong>learn</strong> quick &amp;&amp; <strong>adapt</strong> well &amp;&amp; <strong>work</strong> hard &amp;&amp;
            <strong>solve</strong> problems.
        </p>

            <h3>Career History</h3>
        </header>
        <h4><strong>Telefonica O2 Ltd</strong> : Sept 2012 – Present</h4>
        <h5>July 2014 - Present: <strong>Software Engineer</strong></h5>
        <p>
            <strong>Current Project</strong> - I am working on the <strong>backend services and
            middleware</strong> for a new mobile app that supports O2's car insurance offering - <a href="http://www.o2.co.uk/drive">O2 Drive</a>.
            I am creating <strong>RESTful APIs</strong>, dealing with encryption, authentication and
            authorisation, and integrating with multiple third parties.
            I am also working on the <a href="http://www.o2.co.uk/apps/drive">O2 Drive Android App</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong><a href="https://www.o2.co.uk/shop">O2 Online Shop</a></strong> - I added functionality
            to view existing tariff usage alongside upgrade options and recommendations, to give customers a
            <strong>better upgrade experience</strong>. I wrote both Java and JavaScript (Angular) for this
            application.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>New E-commerce Checkout Application</strong> - the aim was to <strong>improve customer
            drop out rates</strong> through better user experience and design. We more than halved the
            number of steps a customer has to go through to make a purchase. We dramatically improved the
            <strong>look and feel</strong> of the user journeysand the <strong>architecture</strong> of the
            application, <strong>reducing complexity, improving readability and subsequently increasing
            maintainability</strong>. The outcome being acquisition conversion rates rising 31%, and upgrade net
            sales value rising 52%. I started off as an apprentice QA, then moved to a java developer role
            through pairing and self teaching.
        </p>

            Apprenticeship scheme which offered work experience and learning on the job. The apprenticeship
            consisted of four 6 month placements spanning two years. </p>

                Excel, Access and VBA. SAP Business Objects to extract raw data.
