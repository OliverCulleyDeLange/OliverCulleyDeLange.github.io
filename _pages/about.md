# Oliver Culley de Lange

I started my software career in March 2014 as an apprentice at O2, teaching myself Java and learning on the job. I had been messing around with HTML, CSS and Javascript for a good few years. I gradually moved on to PHP but my brain was a little primitive to fully understand what it was all about. I started programming in VBA in November 2012 which taught me the basics and concepts of programming but no OOP. Finally I met Java, and finally understood what it was all about.

While I am predominantly a server side Java developer, I'm a bit of a jack of all trades, although I think they're called 'full stack' developers these days. I've done a bit of front end work, a bit of devops like infrastructure work on AWS, a bit of Android development, and I even do a bit of test automation now and again!

# This blog exists because...

... occasionally, I spend a long time googling something, or reading a large amount of documentation to figure something tricky out.

This is a space for me to write about these things, and hopefully someone down the line will spend less time googling the problem than I did.

Thats the idea anyway...
